              Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is often regarded as one
              of the best footballers to have ever played the game and his
              performances over the better part of a decade have only helped in
              reinforcing that belief among football fans. Ronaldo grew up in
              Madeira, Portugal but after graduating from the youth set up at
              Sporting CP he was immediately snapped up by English club
              Manchester United after his talent as a winger was spotted by
              their legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

              Lionel Messi is a football player from Argentina who plays for FC
              Barcelona. He has won the Ballon D'Or, the annual award given to
              the best player in the world, 7 times and an Olympic gold medal
              winner in 2008. He was born in 1987 in Rosario, Argentina's
              third-biggest city. He showed an enormous aptitude for football
              and was in the youth teams for Newell's Old Boys, his local team.
              Faced with mounting medical expenses to treat a growth hormone
              condition, Messi's family accepted an offer to move the
              13-year-old prodigy to FC Barcelona, who would pay for his
              treatment.

              Neymar began playing football as a boy in São Vicente, under the
              guidance of his father, a former professional footballer who
              remained a close adviser and mentor throughout his son’s career.
              Having played street and indoor five-a-side football, Neymar
              joined Portuguesa Santista’s youth team in São Vicente, and in
              2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There Neymar, who was
              already an impressive player, joined the youth academy of Santos
              FC (the same club for which Brazilian football legend Pelé starred
              over the majority of his domestic career).
